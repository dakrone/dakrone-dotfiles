Suggested Vim Mappings
**********************

Since each person has their own preference when it comes to key
mappings, eclim deliberately omits any convenience mappings for the
provided functionality.

So, instead this page provides some suggested mappings and examples
that may or may not suit your tastes, but will at least give you a
template that you can use to define your own mappings.

Note: In the mappings below you will see <leader> used quite frequently.
  In Vim the <leader> argument is mapped to a character of your
  choice.  Please see ":help mapleader" in Vim for more information.
