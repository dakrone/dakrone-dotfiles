Element Search
==============

Element searching allows you to place the cursor over just about any
element in a source file (method call, class name, constant) and
perform a search for that element by issuing the command
:PhpFindDefinition.

If only one result is found and that result is in the current source
file, the cursor will be moved to the element found.  Otherwise, on
single result matches, the value of |g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult|
will be consulted for the action to take.  If there are multiple
results, the location list will be opened with the list of results.

Note: Searching support is provided via eclim's integration with rope
  (|vim-python-rope|).Please see the rope (|vim-python-rope|) docs for
  more information.
