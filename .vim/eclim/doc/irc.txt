#eclim on freenode.net
======================

If you would like to get help or ask questions on IRC, then feel free
to join #eclim on freenode.net. Please note that I (Eric Van
Dewoestine, ervandew on irc) try to stay in the channel as much as
possible, but I might not be available to answer questions
immediately. It's also worth noting that I live in California, so if
you are in Europe, Asia, or some other timezone whose normal waking
hours don't overlap well with mine, then you may be better off getting
help using the mailing list
(http://groups.google.com/group/eclim-user).
