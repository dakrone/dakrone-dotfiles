Ant Execution
*************

For those that use Vim as an editor and ant as a build tool, is is
common to set your Vim 'makeprg' option to execute ant so that you may
navigate compilation errors via Vim's quickfix functionality.

Eclim utilizes this same paradigm to provide users with ant execution
functionality from any file without any of the setup required by Vim.

*:Ant*

Eclim provides the following command:

:Ant [<target> ...]

which performs the following steps:

- Saves any previous 'makeprg' and 'errorformat' option settings so
  that you can define your own settings for the :make command.

- Sets 'makeprg' to execute ant with the -find option so that it will
  search for your build.xml file in the current directory or in a
  parent directory.

- Sets 'errorformat' to recognize the following errors:

  - javac errors.

  - javadoc errors.

  - jasper jsp compilattion errors.

  - junit errors / failures.

  - cactus errors / failures.

- Executes :make.

- Restores your previous 'makeprg' and 'errorformat' option settings.

Additionally, if g:EclimMakeLCD (|g-eclimmakelcd|) is enabled (which
it is by default), then the execution of ant will be performed from
the current buffer's project root directory, ensuring that ant's build
file discovery method is performed from the buffer's working directory
and not your own.

Note: :Ant also supports use of '!' (:Ant!) just like :make does, which
  tells Vim not to jump to the first error if one exists.

The :Ant command also has the added benefit of command completion.

   :Ant com<Tab>
   :Ant compile

Warning: If your ant file has a lot of imports, then the command completion
  may be slow as Eclipse parses all the imports when creating the ant
  model.  You will notice the same slow behavior when using Eclipse
  directly to perform ant code completion.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables

*g:EclimAntCompilerAdditionalErrorFormat*

- g:EclimAntCompilerAdditionalErrorFormat (Default: '') - Since there
  are many more ant tasks beyond javac, javadoc, etc., eclim provides
  this variable as a means to add error format information for any
  additional ant tasks that you may be using.

  Example: Adding support for xslt

  >
     let g:EclimAntCompilerAdditionalErrorFormat =
       \ '\%A%.%#[xslt]\ Loading\ stylesheet\ %f,' .
       \ '\%Z%.%#[xslt]\ %.%#:%l:%c:\ %m,'

  <

  Note: The xslt task is a bit flaky when it comes to reporting the file
    name on errors, so the above format will catch successful runs as
    well.  If anyone has a better solution, please submit it.
