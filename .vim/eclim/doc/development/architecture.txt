Eclim Architecture
******************

The eclim architecture is pretty straight forward.  Commands issued by
a user in vim are relayed via nailgun
(http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/) to the running eclim daemon
and the proper command implementation is then located and executed.

Here is a diagram showing the sequence in a bit more detail:

The commands which are executed on the eclimd side are also fairly
simply. They accept an object containing the command line parameters
passed into the eclimd invocation and then return a string
representing the output.  Below is a simple class diagram showing the
hierarchy of a couple typical commands.

Another important aspect of eclim's architecture is support for
plugins. Plugins for eclim are bundled as eclipse plugins with their
auto start attribute set to false.  When the eclim daemon starts it
will locate and load any eclipse plugin with an 'org.eclim.' prefix.

When a plugin is loaded, eclim will locate the plugin's required
resources provider and invoke its initialize method which will then
inject its resources (messages, command options, etc) into eclim and
register any new commands.

Here is graphical representation of this process:
