Python Mode News
================
New in version 6.0.3
--------------------

- ipython integration started

- commands `ipython', `python2', `python3', `jython', `python'
  opening a respective python shell

-  py-shift-block-left, py-shift-block-right etc.
  Implemented forms that way are
  "paragraph" "block" "clause" "def" "class" "line" "statement"

- py-dedent
  Dedent line according to `py-indent-offset'. With
  arg, do it that many times. If point is between
  indent levels, dedent to next level. Stops at BOL.
  Returns column reached, if dedent done, nil otherwise.

- py-indent-forward-line
  Indent line and move one line forward. If
  `py-kill-empty-line' is non-nil, delete an empty
  line. When closing a form, use py-close-block et al,
  which will move and indent likewise. Returns position.

- py-down-block
  Go to the beginning of next block below current level.
  Returns position if block inside found, nil otherwise.

- py-close-block, -clause, -def, class
  Set indent level to that of beginning of definition.
  If final line isn't empty and
  `py-close-block-provides-newline' non-nil, insert a
  newline. Returns column.

- new commands specifying the shell override
  `py-shell-name' for execution
  implemented shells are "python" "python2" "python2.7"
  "python3" "python3.2" "jython"

  available with default, -switch and -no-switch
  option, i.e.
  py-execute-region-python3.2
  py-execute-region-python3.2-switch
  py-execute-region-python3.2-no-switch etc.

  Docstring of py-execute-region-python3.2-switch for
  example: "Send the region to a common shell calling the
  python3.2 interpreter. Ignores setting of
  `py-shell-switch-buffers-on-execute', output-buffer
  will being switched to."

- Declarations
  Deal with assigments resp. statements in current
  level which don't open blocks. Provides common edit
  functions as copy, mark, kill, goto beg/end.

  Functions will be used typically to grasp
  initialisations resp. assignements of variables
  between the definition of a class or method and it's
  body, likewise global stuff at the head of a file.

- column-marker.el
  Commands `column-marker-1', `column-marker-2', and
  `column-marker-3' each highlight a given column
  (using different background colors by default).

  M-x column-marker-1 highlights the column where the
  cursor is, in face `column-marker-1'.

  C-u 70 M-x column-marker-2 highlights column 70 in
  face `column-marker-2'.

  C-u 70 M-x column-marker-3 highlights column 70 in
  face `column-marker-3'. The face `column-marker-2'
  highlighting no longer shows.

  C-u M-x column-marker-3 turns off highlighting for
  column-marker-3, so face `column-marker-2'
  highlighting shows again for column 70.

  C-u C-u M-x column-marker-1 (or -2 or -3) erases all
  column highlighting.

  Thanks a lot to it's author Rick Bielawski <rbielaws@i1.net>,
  to Drew Adams for his care and Emacs Wiki hosting it.

New in version 6.0.2
--------------------

- py-electric-comment

  "Insert a comment. If starting a comment, indent
   accordingly. If a numeric argument ARG is provided,
   that many colons are inserted non-electrically. With
   universal-prefix-key C-u a \"#\" Electric behavior
   is inhibited inside a string or comment."

- New commands `py-partial-expression':

  "." operators delimit a partial-expression on it's
  level.

  Given the function below, `py-partial-expression'
  called at pipe symbol would copy and return:

  def usage():
      print """Usage: %s
      ....""" % (
          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  ------------|-------------------------
  ==> path

          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  ------------------|-------------------
  ==> basename(sys.argv[0]))

          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  --------------------------|-----------
  ==> sys

          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  ------------------------------|-------
  ==> argv[0]

  while `py-expression' would copy and return

  (
          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))

  ;;;;;

  Also for existing commands a shorthand is defined:

  (defalias 'py-statement 'py-copy-statement)

  which will mark, copy and return.

- Commands implementing a behavior which customizing of
 `py-shell-switch-buffers-on-execute' would do:

  py-execute-buffer-no-switch
  py-execute-buffer-switch
  py-execute-region-no-switch
  py-execute-region-switch

- Several bugfixes.

New in version 6.0.1
--------------------

- New commands py-expression:

  py-copy-expression
  py-mark-expression
  py-beginning-of-expression
  py-end-of-expression
  py-kill-expression

  Also several of bugfixes are done.

New in version 6.0
--------------------

- Finer grained commands, core re-write.

  As shown below for the `mark'-command, delete,
  copy, jump to beginning and end of the respective
  programming-expressions:

  py-mark-statement
  py-mark-block
  py-mark-block-or-clause
  py-mark-def
  py-mark-def-or-class
  py-mark-class
  py-mark-clause

- Also a couple of bugfixes are done.

New in version 5.2.1
--------------------

- Syntax highlight as a keyword "lambda:" just like "lambda x:".  Given by Dan
  Davison.
- Add "python3" as a key for python-mode in interpreter-mode-alist and
  auto-mode-alist.

New in version 5.2.0
--------------------

- Fixed filling of triple-quoted strings.

- Add new font-lock faces for class names and exception names.

- Do not fill when calling fill-paragraph with point in a region of code.

- Fixed font-locking of exception names in parenthesized lists.

- Fixed font-locking of decorators with arguments.

- Fixed font-locking of triple-quoted strings; single quotes appearing in
  triple-quoted strings no longer upset font-locking.

- Fixed the stack-entry regexp used by pdbtrack so that it now works with
  module-level frames.

- Do not bind C-c C-h; `py-help-at-point' is now on C-c C-e by default.

- hide-show mode is now supported.

- When shifting regions right and left, keep the region active in Emacs.
