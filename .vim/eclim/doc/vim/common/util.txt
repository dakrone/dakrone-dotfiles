Utility Commands
****************

The following is a list of utility commands provided by eclim.  These
are general purpose commands that are useful in and outside the scope
of eclim.

*:LocateFile*

- :LocateFile [file_pattern] - Attempts to locate the supplied file
  pattern or if no argument is supplied, opens a temporary window
  where the text you type is turned into a pattern and search results
  are presented as you type.

  While in this completion mode the following key bindings are
  available:
     - <esc> - close the search window without selecting a file

     - <tab> or <down> - cycle forward through the results

     - <shift><tab> or <up> - cycle backwards through the results

     - <enter> - open the selected file using the default action

     - <ctrl>e - open the selected file via :edit

     - <ctrl>s - open the selected file via :split

     - <ctrl>t - open the selected file via :tabnew

     - <ctrl>l - switch the locate scope

     - <ctrl>h - toggle the help buffer

  By default, the search string accepted by the completion mode is
  intended to be just portions of the file name you are looking for,
  which is then automatically expanded in an effort to help you find
  the file with the fewest keystrokes possible.

  The argument version of :LocateFile on the other hand, accepts a
  hybrid glob/regex pattern.  The glob portion allows you to use * and
  ** to match portions of a path or traverse multiple directories.
  You can mix * and ** with standard perl compatible regex operators
  to construct your search pattern.

  If you prefer the more explicit patterns supported by the argument
  version of :LocateFile over the default "fuzzy" pattern supported by
  the completion version of :LocateFile, then you can turn off the
  fuzzy matching support using the g:EclimLocateFileFuzzy variable
  described below.

  By default, all searching by both variants of this command is
  limited to the current project and any projects listed as
  dependencies, but you can widen the search scope to include all open
  projects by setting g:EclimLocateFileScope to 'workspace', which is
  the default scope when :LocateFile is executed outside of a project.

  In addition to the 'project' and 'workspace' scopes, :LocateFile
  also supports the following scopes:

     - buffers: search listed buffers

     - quickfix: search the quickfix results

     - vcsmodified: search files reported by your vcs as modified or
       untracked.

  Note: For performance reasons, locating files in the 'project' and
    'workspace' scopes depends on eclipse being aware of all your
    project files.  For the most part this is handled automatically as
    you create and edit files within vim.  However, actions you take
    outside of vim or eclipse (moving/removing files, updates from a
    version control system, etc.) will not be visible until you force
    a project refresh via |:ProjectRefresh|.

  Configuration

  Vim Settings

  *g:EclimLocateFileDefaultAction*
  - g:EclimLocateFileDefaultAction (Default: 'split') - Determines the
    command used to open the file when hitting <enter> on an entry in
    the locate file results.

  *g:EclimLocateFileScope*
  - g:EclimLocateFileScope (Default: 'project') - Determines the scope
    for which to search for files.

    - 'project': search only the current project and its dependencies.

    - 'workspace': search the entire workspace (all open projects).

    - 'buffers': search listed buffers

    - 'quickfix': search the quickfix results

    - 'vcsmodified': search files reported by your vcs as modified or
      untracked.

  *g:EclimLocateFileFuzzy*
  - g:EclimLocateFileFuzzy (Default: 1) - Determines whether or not
    'fuzzy' searching will be used on the no arugment version of
    :LocateFile.

*:Tcd*

- :Tcd dir - Mimics vim's :lcd command but sets the current working
  directory local to the current tab instead of just the current
  window.

*:DiffLastSaved*

- :DiffLastSaved - Performs a diffsplit with the last saved version of
  the currently modifed file.

*:SwapWords*

- :SwapWords - Swaps two words (with cursor placed on the first word).
  Supports swapping around non-word characters like commas, periods,
  etc.

*:Sign*

- :Sign - Toggles adding or removing a vim sign on the current line.

*:Signs*

- :Signs - Opens a new window containing a list of signs for the
  current buffer.  Hitting <enter> on one of the signs in the list
  will take you to that sign in the corresponding buffer.

*:SignClearUser*

- :SignClearUser - Removes all vim signs added via :Sign.

*:SignClearAll*

- :SignClearAll - Removes all vim signs.

*:QuickFixClear*

- :QuickFixClear - Removes all entries from the quick fix window.

*:LocationListClear*

- :LocationListClear - Removes all entries from the location list
  window.

*:Buffers*

- :Buffers - Opens a temporary window with a list of all the currently
  listed buffers in vim (like :buffers).  From this list you can open
  any of the files using one of the following shortcuts:

  - E (shift-e) - Open the file with 'edit'.

  - S (shift-s) - Open the file with 'split'.

  - T (shift-t) - Open the file with 'tabnew'.

  - D (shift-d) - Deletes the buffer and removes it from the list.

  - ? - View the help buffer.

  In addition to the above mappings you can also use <return> to
  execute the configured default action on the buffer under the
  cursor.

  To configure the default action you can set the following variable:

  g:EclimBuffersDefaultAction (defaults to 'split')

  By default entries will be sorted by path name, but you may change
  the sorting via these two variables:

  Configuration

  Vim Settings

  *g:EclimBuffersSort*
  - g:EclimBuffersSort (defaults to 'path')  Supports one of 'path',
    'status' (active or hidden), 'bufnr'.

  *g:EclimBuffersSortDirection*
  - g:EclimBuffersSortDirection (defaults to 'asc') Supports one of
    'asc' or 'desc'.

*:BuffersToggle*

- :BuffersToggle - A convenience command which opens the buffers
  window if not open, otherwise closes it.  Useful for creating a key
  mapping to quickly open/close the buffers window.

*:Only*

- :Only - Alternative for vim's :only command.  The purpose of this
  command and the original vim version is to close all but the current
  window.  Unfortunately there is no way to tell the vim version to
  exclude some windows you may wish to keep open (taglist, quickfix,
  etc.).  The eclim version provides that ability via the
  g:EclimOnlyExclude and g:EclimOnlyExcludeFixed variables.

  Configuration

  Vim Settings

  *g:EclimOnlyExclude*
  - g:EclimOnlyExclude (defaults to '^NONE$') - Regex used to match
    buffer names for windows that should not be closed when issuing
    the :Only command.

  *g:EclimOnlyExcludeFixed*
  - g:EclimOnlyExcludeFixed (defaults to 1) When non-0 all fixed
    windows (ones which have 'winfixwidth' or 'winfixheight' set) will
    be preserved when issuing the :Only command.

*:OtherWorkingCopyDiff*

- :OtherWorkingCopyDiff <project> - Diffs the current file against the
  same file in another project (one which has the same project
  relative path). This is most useful if you find yourself doing
  branch development and want to view the differences of the current
  file against one of the other branches.  Supports command line tab
  completion of project names which contain a file with the same
  relative path as the current file: :OtherWorkingCopyDiff <tab>.

*:OtherWorkingCopyEdit*

- :OtherWorkingCopyEdit <project> - Like :OtherWorkingCopyDiff, except
  open the file in the current window.

*:OtherWorkingCopySplit*

- :OtherWorkingCopySplit <project> - Like :OtherWorkingCopyDiff,
  except open the file in a new window.

*:OtherWorkingCopyTabopen*

- :OtherWorkingCopyTabopen <project> - Like :OtherWorkingCopyDiff,
  except open the file in a new tab.
