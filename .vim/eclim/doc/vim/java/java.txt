Java / Javac Support
********************

*:Java*


Executing java
==============

To run the configured main class for your project, you may use the
:Java command, which executes java and displays the results in a
temporary buffer.

Note: Please note that this command is not intended to be a full
  replacement for the more advance support provided by eclipse, ant,
  or maven.

The :Java will locate the main class to run using the following steps:

1. if the first argument is '%' (:Java %) then run the current class.

2. if the setting |org.eclim.java.run.mainclass| is set, then use the
   value as the fully qualified class name to run.

3. lastly, attempt to locate a class containing a static main method,
   if only one is found, use that class.


Configuration
=============

*org.eclim.java.run.mainclass*

Eclim Settings

- org.eclim.java.run.mainclass - Fully qualified name of the class
  containing the main method.

*:Javac*


Executing javac
===============

To compile your project's source code, you may use the :Javac command,
which will run javac on all source files found in your project's src
directories as configured by your .classpath file.  You may use the
|org.eclim.java.compile.sourcepath| setting described below, if you
wish to alter which directories are used.  The resulting class files
will be written to the output path as defined in your project's
.classpath file.

Note: Please note that this command is not intended to be a full
  replacement for javac support provided by more comprehensive build
  tools like ant or maven.


Configuration
=============

Eclim Settings

*org.eclim.java.compile.sourcepath*

- org.eclim.java.compile.sourcepath - The project relative source
  paths to be compiled by javac.  This should be a space separated
  list of project relative source directories which you want javac to
  be executed against.  When unset, all your configured source
  directories will be used.

*:JavaListInstalls*


Viewing list of known JDKs/JREs installed
=========================================

To view a list of all the JDKs/JREs that eclipse is aware of, eclim
provides the command :JavaListInstalls.
