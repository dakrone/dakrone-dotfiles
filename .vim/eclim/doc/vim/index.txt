Introduction
************

As stated in the project description, eclim's main goal is to bring
Eclipse functionality to the Vim editor.  Here you will find
documentation on the functionality that eclim provides.

Note: For installation instructions please see the install guide
  (|guides-install|).

The eclim documentation is broken up into two parts.  The first is the
comprehensive documentation which details the usage and purpose of
every command and setting.  This portion is found under the
"Documentation" sub-menu on the left.  Here you will find
configuration information (settings (|vim-settings|), suggested
mappings (|vim-mappings|), etc.), and the detailed functionality
documentation which is broken up into categories (common
functionality, java development functionality, etc.).

The second portion of the documentation consists of a set of guides
which are written to help you perform specific tasks.  These guides
are located under the "Guides" sub-menu to the left.

Before diving in, you should first familiarize yourself with the
following commands.  After that, take a look at the docs for managing
projects (|vim-common-project|).  Then feel free to move on to the
other categories.

*:PingEclim*

- :PingEclim - Pings eclimd to see if it is up and running.

*:ShutdownEclim*

- :ShutdownEclim - Shuts down the current running eclimd instance.

*:EclimSettings*

- :EclimSettings - Allows you to view / edit the global settings
  (|vim-settings|). For project level settings see the
  |:ProjectSettings| command on the project documentation page
  (|vim-common-project|).

*:EclimDisable*

- :EclimDisable - Allows you to temporarily disable all communication
  with eclimd for the current vim session.  Useful if you need to
  shutdown eclimd for one reason or antoher, and would like to disable
  vim's attempts to communicate with the non-existant server.

*:EclimEnable*

- :EclimEnable - Re-enables communication with eclimd (the converse of
  :EclimDisable).

*:EclimHelp*

- :EclimHelp [<topic>] - Similar to vim's :help command, with the
  exception that this command is limited to opening topics for eclim.

*:EclimHelpGrep*

- :EclimHelp /<pattern>/ - Command which allows you to search the
  eclim help files via vimgrep.

  Ex.

     :EclimHelpGrep /completion/
