Log4j File Validation
*********************

When editing a log4j xml file eclim will default to validating the
file when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current
window's location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding
line number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

Eclim also combines the above validation with xml validation
(|vim-xml-validate|) to validate that the file is well formed.

If you do not want your log4j files validated automatically when
saved, you can set the |g:EclimLog4jValidate| variable described in
the configuration section below.

*:Validate_log4j*

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
the command :Validate to manually execute the validation of the file.


Configuration

  when saving the file.
